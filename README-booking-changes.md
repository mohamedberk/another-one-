# Booking Flow Changes

## Overview

The booking flow has been changed from a modal-based approach to a dedicated page-based flow. This provides a better user experience with more space for booking details and a clearer flow.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed TravelBookingModal Component**:
   - Deleted `app/components/TravelBookingModal.tsx` as it's no longer needed

2. **Created New Booking Page Structure**:
   - Added `app/activities/[id]/booking/page.tsx` - for handling the booking form
   - Added `app/activities/[id]/booking/confirmation/page.tsx` - for booking confirmation

3. **Updated Activity Detail Page**:
   - Changed "Book Now" buttons to link to the new dedicated booking page
   - Simplified the sidebar booking section to direct users to the dedicated booking page

## How the New Booking Flow Works

1. User visits an activity details page
2. User clicks "Book Now" button
3. User is directed to the dedicated booking page for that activity
4. After completing the booking form, user is taken to a confirmation page

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Better UX**: Full-page form provides more space and focus on the booking process
- **SEO Benefits**: Dedicated booking pages can be indexed by search engines
- **Deeper Navigation**: Users can bookmark or share booking pages directly
- **Improved Performance**: Page-based approach reduces JavaScript load on activity detail pages

## Technical Implementation

The booking page uses the activity data from `utils/activities.ts` and leverages the existing `calculateTourPrice` function to determine pricing based on the number of travelers and tour type (private vs. group).
